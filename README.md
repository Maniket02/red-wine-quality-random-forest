# üç∑ Red Wine Quality Prediction Using Random Forest  
### *An Ensemble Learning Approach for Wine Quality Classification*  

---

## üìò **Project Overview**

This project applies a **Random Forest Classifier** ‚Äî an ensemble learning technique ‚Äî to predict the **quality of red wine** based on its physicochemical attributes.  
By leveraging multiple decision trees and averaging their predictions, Random Forest reduces overfitting, enhances accuracy, and identifies key chemical factors that influence wine quality.  

> üß† **Goal:** Predict wine quality (score 0‚Äì10) from features like alcohol, acidity, sulphates, and more.

## üß™ **Dataset Information**

The dataset contains **1,599 samples** of red wine from the *Vinho Verde* region of Portugal, with **11 input features** and **1 target label (`quality`)**.  

### üî¨ **Features:**
- `fixed acidity` ‚Äì Non-volatile acids like tartaric acid  
- `volatile acidity` ‚Äì Acetic acid levels (vinegar taste risk)  
- `citric acid` ‚Äì Adds freshness and flavor  
- `residual sugar` ‚Äì Sugar remaining post fermentation  
- `chlorides` ‚Äì Salt content affecting taste  
- `free sulfur dioxide` & `total sulfur dioxide` ‚Äì Preserve wine quality  
- `density` ‚Äì Related to sugar/alcohol content  
- `pH` ‚Äì Acidity level  
- `sulphates` ‚Äì Antioxidant & microbial protection  
- `alcohol` ‚Äì Alcohol percentage by volume  

### üéØ **Target Variable:**
- `quality` (integer score 0‚Äì10) ‚Äì Sensory rating by experts

## üßÆ **Model Performance**

| Metric | Training | Testing |
|:--------|:----------|:----------|
| **Accuracy** | ~99% | ~89‚Äì92% |
| **Evaluation** | Confusion Matrix, Precision, Recall, F1-score |

‚úÖ **Observations:**
- The model generalizes well without severe overfitting.  
- `Alcohol` and `Volatile Acidity` were strong predictors of wine quality.  
- Random Forest effectively handled variance through ensemble averaging.

## üéì **Conclusion**

Random Forest proved to be a **robust and accurate ensemble method** for predicting wine quality.

- üå≤ **Robust & Accurate:** Combines multiple decision trees to improve reliability  
- üß† **Feature Importance:** Highlights which attributes most influence wine taste  
- üîÅ **Low Variance:** Performs consistently on unseen data  

> **Conclusion:** Random Forest is ideal for this classification problem ‚Äî balancing accuracy, interpretability, and stability.
